Create a VERY simple landing page for my project www.lerkit.com.
What is my project about? I am doing specific chemical equipment - syringe pumps. Nearest example of a similar project: https://www.chemyx.com/
Text for page, photos and logo is attached.
What I need on the webpage:
- Main text in the header.
- Some background(look to attached archive)
- Basic text(look into archive also).
- contact info
- several pictures at the bottom. //Image Galary

Another reference is my friend's website, looks good for me from the "simplicity" point of view.
http://www.proteus-headlamp.com/

This should be html+css+javascript only site, not WordPress or Joomla or other CMS.
